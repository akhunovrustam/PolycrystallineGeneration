3. for the selection of Genetics Algo we can use Random, Tournament and Boltzman selections.

4. the selection is organized as follows: we save best one or more individuals (some percent, let's say 5-10%) other 
individuals of the new offspring are made by tournament crossover (random selection of two individuals and then 
selection of individual with the highest fitness). after crossover we make mutation for some percent.
