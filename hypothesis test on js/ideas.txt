1. even for 2d there are examples when you cannot divide two sets of points into part with the half of whole amount of particles.
this is why if let's say we have probability of crossover 0.01% then we choose 0.1% of all individuals in random order and choose
10% from them. but if meet some pair that cannot be crossovered we just skip it and try to get new pair until we got 10%.
2. the strategy for crossover is to divide one individual ot half-half particles by some crossing plane. then test the same plane for
the second individual. if for the second individual we do not have half-half division of particles we have to try to rotate plane such
that for the first individual we have the same half-half division but for the second one we change division and try to reach half-half
division. if for current first individual's division we cannot reach half-half division for the second one we try it for more 4 
first individual's division. if we could not reach it in 5 attempts then we mark this pair as uncrossoverable pair and we make new pair
and try the same procedure for the new pair.

3. for the selection of Genetics Algo we can use Random, Tournament and Boltzman selections.
