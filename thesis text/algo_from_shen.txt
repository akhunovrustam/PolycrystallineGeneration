BEGIN (GA and LS)  
	Create initial population (p1) randomly  
	Calculate the value of W2 of each individual in p1  
	While Min(W2) > 10^−6, DO   
	BEGIN  
		Produce new population (p2) from initial population (p1) 
		(The two types of  mutations are considered: a new center point is selected completely  randomly; 
		and it randomly shifts a short distance)  
		Determine dynamically the fitness function F by individuals in p1 and p2  
		Select survival individuals from p1 and p2 by the new fitness function F  
		Merge survival individuals in p2 and p1 as p1  
		Calculate the value of W2 of each individual in p1
	END  
	Output the individual
