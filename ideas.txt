3. for the selection of Genetics Algo we can use Random, Tournament and Boltzman selections.

4. the selection is organized as follows: we save best one or more individuals (some percent, let's say 5-10%) other 
individuals of the new offspring are made by tournament crossover (random selection of two individuals and then 
selection of individual with the highest fitness). after crossover we make mutation for some percent.


Questions:
- ask should i extract parameter for crossover max amount of particles for interchange
- ask should i extract parameter for mutation regulate amplitude by coeff

crossover operator
mutation distribution	
mutation_probability
population_size
[cp: 1p, 2p, uniform]
[md: uniform, normal, reinit]
[mp: 0.8, 0.2, 0.05, 0.01]
[ps: 10, 50, 100]

108 configs


2. run size algo for different values and build 2d colored graph



100. Choose multibody potential
0. rewrite crossover for multithreding //useless cause i do not have many cores(((
0. rewrite program to use GPUs instead of CPUs
0. write prog for continueing calc from the given result. for this write all steps info into files
